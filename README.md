# Webpage Element Watcher

A simple .NET 6 console application which periodically watches specific HTML elements on the web.  
Only works for static websites which rely on server-side page rendering.

### Getting started  

This project runs on .NET 6. If `dotnet --version` returns a version number < 6, install the .NET 6 SDK from [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download).  
(May also work on older versions of .NET / .NET Core but this is not tested.)
